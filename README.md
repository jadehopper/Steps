**Please note:** There currently are a few issues when it comes to debugging extensions. Please refer to the **Known Issues >  Debugger** section in the [Xcode 6 Beta Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/download.action?path=/wwdc_2014/xcode_6_beta_ie8g3n/xcode_6_beta__release_notes.pdf) (requires an ï£¿ Developer account) to avoid these.

**Please note:** There currently are a few issues when it comes to debugging extensions. Please refer to the **Known Issues >  Debugger** section in the [Xcode 6 Beta Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/download.action?path=/wwdc_2014/xcode_6_beta_ie8g3n/xcode_6_beta__release_notes.pdf) (requires an ï£¿ Developer account) to avoid these.

You'll need a device running the iOS 8 beta that has an [M7 chip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M7) to test with. Currently that's iPhone 5S, iPad Air and the iPad Mini with Retina Display.
